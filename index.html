    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Project Ultramaroon started as me just renaming a simple proxy and changing the logo. It then evolved into the earlier versions of this site, and eventually I stopped developing this site with my friend and moved on to making a proxy frontend. Now, I am back with this site which is looking better than ever with a login system, Discord server widget, and a lot more games than the old one. So I hope you enjoy it! -Greatshot101</p>
